        <h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing is the use of internet-based services to store, manage, and process data, instead of using a personal computer or local server. It allows people and organizations to use computing resources (like storage, servers, and software) on demand, without having to own or maintain physical hardware.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, cloud computing means using someone else’s powerful computers over the internet to run your applications or store your files.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost Efficiency: You don’t need to buy expensive computers or servers. You only pay for what you use.</li>
            <li>Scalability: Cloud services can easily grow with your needs. You can increase or decrease storage and computing power anytime.</li>
            <li>Accessibility: You can access your data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
            <li>Automatic Updates: The cloud provider handles software and security updates for you.</li>
            <li>Data Backup and Recovery: Cloud services often include automatic backup and recovery options, protecting you from data loss.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Cloud (Deployment Models)</h2>
        <h3>1. Public Cloud</h3>
        <p>The cloud resources are owned and operated by third-party providers such a Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. Anyone can use these services on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
        <p>Example: Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>

        <h3>2. Private Cloud</h3>
        <p>The cloud infrastructure is used by only one organization. It provides higher security and control but can be more expensive to manage.</p>
        <p>Example: A company that runs its own cloud system internally.</p>

        <h3>3. Hybrid Cloud</h3>
        <p>This combines both public and private clouds. Sensitive data can be stored in the private cloud,while less-sensitive tasks use the public cloud. This model gives flexibility and efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Types of Cloud Services (Service Models)</h2>
        <h3>1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>
        <p>Provides virtual servers, storage, and networking. You manage your own applications,while the provider manages the hardware.</p>
        <p>Examples: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.</p>

        <h3>2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
        <p>Provides tools and environments for developers to build, test, and deploy applications. The provider manages the infrastructure and runtime environment.</p>
        <p>Examples: Google App Engine, Azure App Service.</p>

        <h3>3. Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
        <p>Provides ready-to-use applications over the internet. You don’t need to install or manage the software yourself.</p>
        <p>Examples:Gmail, Microsoft 365, Zoom.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Cloud computing has transformed how people and businesses use technology. It offers flexibility, reliability, and cost savings while giving users access to computing power from anywhere. Whether it’s for storing files, building applications, or running large-scale operations, the cloud is shaping the future of the digital world.</p>
